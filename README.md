The integration of reinforcement learning (RL) into the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has rapidly emerged as a transformative research direction. While MLLMs significantly extend Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle diverse modalities such as vision, audio, and video, enabling robust reasoning across multimodal inputs remains challenging. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in RL-based reasoning for MLLMs, covering key algorithmic designs, reward mechanism innovations, and practical applications. We highlight two main RL paradigms‚Äîvalue-model-free and value-model-based methods‚Äîand analyze how RL enhances reasoning abilities by optimizing reasoning trajectories and aligning multimodal information. Furthermore, we provide an extensive overview of benchmark datasets, evaluation protocols, and existing limitations, and propose future research directions to address current bottlenecks such as sparse rewards, inefficient cross-modal reasoning, and real-world deployment constraints. Our goal is to offer a comprehensive and structured guide to researchers interested in advancing RL-based reasoning in the multimodal era.

| Core Insights   | Effective long2short methods that use long-CoT techniques to improve short-CoT models, yielding state-of-the-art short-CoT reasoning results, outperforming existing short-CoT models.The author derives a long-CoT (Chain-of-Thought) RL formulation and employs a variant of online mirror descent to achieve policy optimization. By incorporating sampling strategies, length penalties, and data balancing, the method enables MLLMs (Multi-Layered Learning Models) to acquire chain-of-thought reasoning that exhibits characteristics of planning, reflection, and correction.To alleviate the overthinking phenomenon, the author proposes a length-penalized RL approach and multiple Long2Short methods. |

| Reward Function | Rule-based reward (Accuracy, Format)                         |
| Core Insights   | The insight behind the method lies in decoupling the alignment of visual-language representations from the preservation of reasoning capabilities. The authors propose to align the vision encoder with the reasoning-capable language backbone by solely training an MLP-based vision adapter. This approach enables the model to acquire visual perception capabilities while retaining its reasoning abilities. The authors propose a hybrid optimization strategy that combines Iterative Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), significantly enhancing cross-modal integration efficiency. Additionally, they introduce an adaptive-length Chain-of-Thought distillation approach for reasoning data generation. This approach dynamically optimizes reasoning chain lengths, thereby enhancing inference efficiency and preventing excessive reasoning overthinking. |
